# Noitavania
Noitavania is a vanilla-friendly (kinda) map expansion project that fills once empty space with new and expanded biomes, providing a metroidvania-like world experience.

## What does this mod do?
* Opens up the map with more inter-biome connectivity.
* Greatly expands previously empty areas with new (From across the modding community and I) and returning biomes.
* Adds additional secrets and rewards across the map.
* Adds a sprawling Nightmare/NG+ map alternative, with an almost entirely different approach to the map design. (*Really* departed from vanilla)
* Adds mini-temples to the expanded side areas to encourage and reward the brave explorer.
* Adds a new mini-boss with custom sprites, found deep in the new Castle biome. (more mini-bosses to come!)
