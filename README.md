# Noitavania
Noitavania is a vanilla-friendly (kinda) map expansion project that fills once empty space with new and expanded biomes, aiming to provide a metroidvania-like world experience, as well as providing a new and interesting map challenge for Nightmare/NG+.

This mod was originally created during Early Access and besides Noita+ was the only other map mod to exist. Development has resumed post-1.0, working on and adding new biomes created from scratch rather than just borrowing from other popular biome mods.

This is the current development version of Noitavania and will contain unfinished content and probably bugs. The released version of the mod is 1.22 available on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2263080245).

## What does this mod do?
* Opens up the map with more inter-biome connectivity.
* Greatly expands previously empty areas with new and returning biomes, created by myself and other members of the modding community.
* Reworks the cavernous and empty areas of the vanilla map to have stuff to actually do besides fall asleep as you dig through miles of Extremely Dense Rock.
* Adds additional secrets and rewards across the map.
* Adds a sprawling Nightmare/NG+ map alternative, with an almost entirely different approach to the map design. (_Really_ departed from vanilla)
* Adds mini-temples to the expanded side areas to encourage and reward the brave explorer.
* Adds new mini-bosses with custom sprites, found in the furtherst parts of the map.
* Works with Horscht's [Location Tracker](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2227903743) (Minimap Mod)!
